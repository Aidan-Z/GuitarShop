**QA FINAL PROJECT: GUITAR SHOP**

* This project is the backend code for a guitar shop, where you (should) be able to call certain methods and have results (guitars containing the requested attributes) returned to you.

* I am doing this project as my final work for my QA course, to show that I can (within reason) implement all things learnt over the course of the bootcamp and produce a functioning CRUD backend project.

* I thought the project would be relatively easy as long as I had previous work to guide myself with... I was wrong

* I personally feel that the actual code/ functionality part of my project went well and worked as intended- although I approached the project the wrong way. Although my code and methods worked as intended, I struggled with writing tests, and found them confusing. I also encountered problems with my database and needed assistance resolving them.

* Next time I will definitely be more meticulous with my planning, because this time I was too trigger happy and wanted to get into the coding as soon as possible. As stated earlier, I approached this project in the wrong wayâ€¦ although I was writing backend code, I was thinking of it from the perspective of a customer, and I feel this affected the function of the code I wrote.
